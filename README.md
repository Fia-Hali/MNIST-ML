# MNIST-ML

Train MNISL models on downscaled images with the following sizes: 14x14, 7x7, 4x4, 2x2.   
Used both One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) strategies.   
Augment the data with derived features in order to help the classifier.   
Use pytorch to perform backpropagation and compute gradients for neural networks.   
Report result.
